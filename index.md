  - [SamuraiWTF](https://github.com/SamuraiWTF/samuraiwtf)
    Co-headed by local member and developer  [Jason Gilliam](https://github.com/JGillam), SamuraiWTF is a framework designed for quickly configuring training
    virtual machines with
    tools and vulnerable application targets. This of this as a base box with a specialized package manager. For example, an instructor could use SamuraiWTF to
    easily set up a classroom virtual machine image containing OWASP ZAP and OWASP Juice Shop, and then distribute it to each student.
