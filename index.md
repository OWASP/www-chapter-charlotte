## Chapter Meetings

We meet the **2nd Wednesday of each Month** our location is currently in a state of flux, but hope to have that squared away by April 2020

We hold a Meet and Greet beginning at 6:30pm. Food and beverages are
provided.

Please Signup on [**Meet-Up**](https://www.meetup.com/owaspCLT) so we
can have an accurate count for food.

## Local News

  - One of our projects,
    [AppSensor](https://owasp.org/www-project-appsensor/migrated_content)
    headed by lead developer and local member John Melton, was selected
    as a GSOC project. This is a very exciting new feature that will
    pave the way for a server/client model of
    [AppSensor](https://owasp.org/www-project-appsensor/migrated_content).

<!-- end list -->

  - We now have a [Power Point
    Presentation](Media:Charlotte_OWASP_Presentation_Template.ppt "wikilink")
