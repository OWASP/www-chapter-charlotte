## Chapter Meetings

Started in 2010, we are the CLT area's chapter for OWASP Global. We typical meet the **4 Times a Year.** Sometimes more, we hope to also see you during the [Cyber Security Symposium](https://cybersecuritysymposium.uncc.edu/)

We hold a Meet and Greet **(Virtually During this time of COVID)** beginning at 7:00pm. Food and beverages are
provided. **(Suspended during this time of COVID, Feel free to drink and eat at your house, we for sure will be doing that!)**

Please Signup on [**Meet-Up**](https://www.meetup.com/owaspCLT) so we
can have an accurate count for food.

## Local News

  - One of our projects,
    [AppSensor](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-appsensor)
    headed by lead developer and local member [John Melton](https://github.com/jtmelton), was selected
    as a GSOC project. This is a very exciting new feature that will
    pave the way for a server/client model of AppSensor
